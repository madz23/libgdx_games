This is the game from the libGDX tutorial at https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/a-simple-game.

# zombie

3/30
A simple animation using the sprite sheet and tutorial at https://libgdx.com/wiki/graphics/2d/2d-animation.

This file was called runningMan, but has since been changed to use a zombie sprite I found at https://www.gameart2d.com/freebies.html, since most free sprites are not organized in a sprite sheet but in separate images. In any case, I can use both now.

# soundBoard

3/31
I like finding free sounds online, and I needed to learn more about widgets so I built this very ugly sound board. I need to work on skins and tables, but it was fun.

All the sounds come from https://freesound.org.

# moo

4/2
This is the only "game" worthy of note and the only project here that will likely evolve into a more developed and likely playable game. The animation for the cow was all done by me, but the libGDX skin and sounds are currently being pulled from free websites. More information to come as I actually work on this. As of now, the there is a main menu screen with a play button which takes you to the cow screen where you can control the cow with the arrow keys.
