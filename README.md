# simpleGame

3/30
This is the game from the libGDX tutorial at https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/a-simple-game.

# zombie

3/30
A simple animation using the sprite sheet and tutorial at https://libgdx.com/wiki/graphics/2d/2d-animation.

3/31
This file was called runningMan, but has since been changed to use a zombie sprite I found at https://www.gameart2d.com/freebies.html, since most free sprites are not organized in a sprite sheet but in separate images. In any case, I can use both now.

# soundBoard

3/31
I like finding free sounds online, and I needed to learn more about widgets so I built this very ugly sound board. I need to work on skins and tables, but it was fun.

All the sounds come from https://freesound.org.
